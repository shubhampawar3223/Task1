Que.1. Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2.
Ans.:
      HTTP/1.1                                    HTTP/2.0
-It was released in year 1997.           -It was released in year 2015.

-It is slower than HTTP/2.0.             -It is faster and efficient than HTTP/1.1.

Que.2. HTTP version history.
Ans.:
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee 
and his team between 1989-1991, HTTP has seen many changes, keeping most of the simplicity and further shaping its flexibility.

HTTP/0.9: The initial version had no any number.HTTP/0.9 is extremely simple as it's requests consist of a single line and start with the 
only possible method GET followed by the path to the resource.There were no header in it only HTML files were transmitted.

HTTP/1.0: It was launched during 1991-1995. Header's were included in HTTP/1.0. With the help of HTTP header the ability to transmit  other 
documents along with plain HTML was added.Due to header whole system became faster and efficient.
A status code line is also sent at the beginning of the response, allowing the browser itself to understand the success or failure of the
request and to adapt its behavior in consequence

HTTP/1.1:It was released in 1995.
Following are few keypoints which were included in HTTP/1.1:
-Additional cache control mechanism was added.
-Connection reusability.
-Chunked responses were also supported.
-Pipelining has been added, allowing to send a second request before the answer for the first one is fully transmitted, lowering the latency of the communication.
-Content negotiation, including language, encoding, or type, has been introduced, and allows a client and a server to agree on the most adequate content to exchange.

HTTP/1.1 was used over 15 years.During this time the protocol was refined over two times.

HTTP/2.0:It was officially standardised in 2015.
Googl's experimental SPDY protocol ledded foundation for HTML/2.0.It is fast and efficient than HTTP/1.1.
HTTP didn't stop evolving upon the release of HTTP/2. Like with HTTP/1.x previously, HTTP's extensibility is still being used to add new features.

Que.3:List 5 differences between Browser JS vs Node Js.
Ans.:
             Node.js                                                    Browser.js 
-It has full user level system access.                   -It doesn't have full user level system access.
-Node doesn't have a predefined "window" object          -"window" is a predefined global object which has functions and 
cause it doesn't have a window to draw anything.	      attributes, that have to deal with window that has been drawn.
-In Node everything is a module. You must keep           -Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript, i.e. in browsers. 
your code inside a module.
-Node processes request object.                          -Browsers processes response objects.
-"require" object is predefined in Node which            -Browsers don't have "require" predefined. You may include it in your app for asynchronous file loading.
is used to include modules in the app.

Que.4.What happens when you type a URL in the address bar in the browser?
Ans.:
-Browser checks cache for DNS entry to find the corresponding IP address of website.
-If not found in cache then, ISP's DNS server initiates a DNS query to find IP address of server that hosts the query name.
-Browser initiates the TCP connection with the server using SYN and ACK message.
-Browser sends HTTP request to the web server.
-Server on the host computer handles that request and sends back a response. It assembles a response in some format like JSON, XML and HTML.
-Server sends out an HTTP response along with the status of response.
-Then rendering engine tokenise the data and create variou DOM, CSSOM,AST trees.
-UI backend and browser component displays the content to the user.
